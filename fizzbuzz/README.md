# Fizz Buzz in Valida

Fizz buzz is a word game. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz".
## System requirements

This template supports x86-64 Linux. [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is required. Arch Linux and Ubuntu are specifically supported, with other platforms possibly requiring some tinkering to make work.

## Toolchain installation

To run this project in the Valida VM, you need the Valida toolchain installed. Go to [LLVM Valida releases](https://github.com/lita-xyz/llvm-valida-releases/releases) to find the latest release. Download the release tarball, extract it, `cd` into the extracted folder, and run `sudo ./install.sh`.

## Entering the Valida shell

To put the Valida toolchain on your PATH, you can enter the Valida shell by running `valida-shell` in your shell. The above installation process should have resulted in `valida-shell` being on your `PATH`.

## Usage

Build the project, from the root directory of this repo:

```
cargo +valida build --release
```

To run the program, in the Valida shell, from the root directory of this repo:

```
valida> valida run ./target/valida-unknown-baremetal-gnu/release/fizzbuzz log
```

The `run` command runs the program and asks the user for a number, then prints the numbers from 1 to that number, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz", to the console and the file `log` in the current directory.
